Installation
============

First, you'll want a Python installation
(we test with versions 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4; 3.2 probably works),
and reasonably recent versions of 
`numpy <http://numpy.org>`_,
`scipy <http://scipy.org>`_,
and `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_.
If you're not already attached to a particular install of Python,
we recommend the `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_
distribution, which makes life easy;
otherwise, `these instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_
might be helpful.
Note that skl-groups is not currently tested on Windows (or FreeBSD, or anything
other than recent versions of OSX, Arch, and CentOS). If you try it, let us
know.

skl-groups is not yet available via the standard Python package distribution
mechanisms, because it's too early to be tagging released versions. (Soon.)

In the meantime, you can install it by getting the code from
`the repository <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/issues>`_,
either with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups.git

or by downloading and extracting the latest version 
`as a ZIP <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/archive/master.zip>`_.
Then just run::

    $ python setup.py install

to install it. You might need to add ``--user`` to install into your home
directory, or run it with ``sudo``, depending on your setup.

If you chose to clone the repository, you can update the code later by running
``git pull`` and then ``python setup.py install`` again.


FLANN
-----

If you want to use :class:`skl_groups.divergences.KNNDivergenceEstimator`,
you'll also need a Python interface to
`FLANN <http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/>`_
(the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors),
either the ``pyflann`` library included with FLANN or 
`cyflann <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/cyflann/>`_.
If you're using Anaconda, the best way to get it is::

    $ conda install -c http://conda.binstar.org/dougal cyflann

Otherwise, check your package manager or install it from source.


Accelerated version
-------------------

Some algorithms
(currently just :class:`skl_groups.divergences.KNNDivergenceEstimator`)
have faster C implementations in the
`skl-groups-accel <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups-accel/>`_
package, which is kept separate to make the "base" skl-groups easier to install.

skl-groups-accel requires
`cyflann <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/cyflann/>`_
(pyflann is insufficient â€“ in fact, this code is why cyflann was written)
and a recent version of `cython <http://cython.org/>`_
as well as a functioning C compiler with OpenMP support
(i.e. gcc, not clang, `for now <http://clang-omp.github.io>`_).
Once you have that, get it with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups-accel.git

or `as a ZIP <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/archive/master.zip>`_
and install it the same way (*after* installing skl-groups).
