Who this package is for
=======================

This documentation is written assuming that you're familiar with Python,
numpy, and the basic structure of scikit-learn. The explanations of methods
also assume a certain amount of mathematical familiarity with the math behind
machine learning techniques, though hopefully not too much; that's what the
paper references are for.

Our goals for the not-too-distant future hope to alleviate this in two ways:

* A set of simple command-line tools to avoid having to write any Python code
  for basic tasks; you can set up your inputs in, say, an HDF5 file or a
  directory structure of images, and then run some commands to process them
  and get predictions or whatever you're looking for out.

* Better introductions to and descriptions of the methods for people who aren't
  machine learning researchers to understand what the methods are doing, why
  you would pick one over another, and so on.

If you try out the package, we'd also very much appreciate any feedback on your
user experience, either by email or on the
`GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/issues>`_.
