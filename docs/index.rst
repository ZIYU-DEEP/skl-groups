Introduction
============

skl-groups is a package that extends the Python machine learning toolkit
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ with support for operating on
sets ("groups") as features. What does that mean? Well, then you can do
all the standard machine learning tasks on:

* galaxy clusters that are made of individual galaxies
* images treated as sets of local patches
* the set of tweets from a given area and time
* the set of internet browsing traffic from a geographic country for a day
* the set of velocity vectors from a region of a vector field
* ...lots of other things! `Get in touch <dsutherl@cs.cmu.edu>`_ to talk about
  how to frame your learning problem, or give it a shot yourself.

The canonical source for the documentation is
`here <https://dougalsutherland.github.io/skl-groups/>`_,
and the source code, issue tracker, etc. is
`on GitHub <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups>`_.
skl-groups is currently in fairly early stages of development, and so not
everything will necessarily work as smoothly as it could.
We're working on that, but as you use the package / read this documentation /
etc, please feel free to give feedback on anything via the
`GitHub issues page <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/issues/>`_
or by `email <dsutherl@cs.cmu.edu>`_.
