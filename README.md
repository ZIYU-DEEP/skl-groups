This is a work-in-progress generalization of
[`py-sdm`](https://github.com/dougalsutherland/py-sdm/)
to allow for other types of learning on groups
and to normalize the API to be a little more like that of scikit-learn proper.

It's currently in very early stages of development;
feel free get in touch if you're interested.
